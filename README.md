🔴 CRTA - Certified Read Team Analyst (Exam) 🔴

The Certified Red Team Analyst (CRTA) is a 48-hour hands-on exam simulating a real-world red team engagement inside an Active Directory environment.

You’ll have:

⏱ 24 hours to perform the attack:

Enumerate the network

Gain access

Pivot between hosts

Escalate privileges

Locate and exfiltrate the main target: secrets.xml

🕐 24 additional hours to submit your report:

Include screenshots, command outputs, and a clear attack path

Explain your techniques, tools, and how you achieved objectives

The report quality is critical — it determines your pass/fail

Goal: Simulate a stealthy red team operation against AD, showing not just technical skill but also professional documentation.
